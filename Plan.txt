TreeNodes (individual):
 - Each contain
  - A piece of data (single string for now)
  - A parent pointer
  - A pointer to a child vector (vector contains other TreeNodes)
 * The root node's parent will be set to nullptr (how it will be differentiated/found)
 Methods:
  + Getters/Setters
  + getParent() 
  

Menu:
 Commands - 
   dir - list all entries in current directory
   cd - change directory (use form C:/Users/Brooks)
   mkdir - creates a new directory
   touch - create a new entry in the current directory
   delete - deletes entered entry
   return - regresses current directory by 1 (unless its the root ~directory)



The Tree needs to provide the following functionality:
 - One root 
 - After root sub-directories can have unlimited children
 - Insert (node) / Delete (node) / getParentDirectory () / 'dir' lists current directory
 - Tree creation adds info to a text file and retreives to build tree

For Insert:
 - The current directory must be known (using getParent)
 - Individual element is added to child vector
 -
